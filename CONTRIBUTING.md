**Clone and install**

    git clone https://github.com/baochip/bao-vscode-ext.git
    cd bao-vscode-ext
    npm install

**Dev tooling**
- Install git hooks: `pre-commit install`
- Run local checks as needed: `pre-commit run`

**Run the extension**
1. Open the repo folder in VS Code.  
2. `npm run compile`
2. Press **F5** (or Run → **Start Debugging**) to launch an **Extension Development Host**.  
3. Use the Command Palette to try Baochip commands and verify changes.
